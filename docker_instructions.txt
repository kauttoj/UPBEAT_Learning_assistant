Testing locally:

docker build -t gradio-app .
docker run -p 7860:7860 gradio-app

Deploying into OpenShift compatible server that supports container image upload, such as CSC Rahti service:

1. Make a Docker hub account that allows easy image sharing. Get your username <USERNAME>
2. At console, login to the docker hub
docker login  OR  docker login -u <user> -p <pass>
3. At root folder where Dockerfile is located run
docker build -t <USERNAME>/learning_assistant .
4. If no errors, push image to the hub:
docker push <USERNAME>/learning_assistant
VERY IMPORTANT: Make sure your image is in PRIVATE mode unless you want to share it publibly. On default, images are PUBLIC. For Docker hub, you can only have 1 private image for free user. Other services settings might vary.
5. Go to CSC Rahti or similar OpenShift server console, make a new project and create a new app choosing "container image" and "Image name from external registry"
6. use this address which should work
docker.io/<USERNAME>/learning_assistant
7. no other settings are needed, except maybe some name you want to use

As the app is created and started (without errors), you can go into provided public URL and test your app
